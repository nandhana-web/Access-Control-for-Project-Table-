📋 Access Control for Project Table

This project provides a robust Access Control System for managing permissions on a Project Table, ensuring secure and organized handling of project data. It features role-based access control (RBAC) that restricts access based on user roles, making it ideal for project management applications where data privacy and security are paramount.

🚀 Key Features

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Defines user roles like Admin, Project Manager, and Viewer, each with specific access permissions.

Granular Permissions: Controls access at the action level (Create, Read, Update, Delete) based on user roles.

Authentication & Authorization: Integrates secure login using JWT/OAuth, ensuring that only verified users can access the system.

Middleware Protection: Utilizes Express.js middleware for enforcing access rules and preventing unauthorized operations.

Logging & Audit Trail: Tracks user activities and changes made to project data for enhanced traceability.

Responsive UI: Built with React.js for an intuitive and responsive user experience across all devices.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT/OAuth

Middleware: Custom authorization and validation middleware

⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm installed

MongoDB installed or access to a MongoDB Atlas instance


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/access-control-project-table.git
cd access-control-project-table


2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install


3. Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the server/ directory with the following:

MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key>
PORT=5000


4. Run the application:

# Start the server
cd server
npm start

# Start the frontend
cd ../client
npm start


5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.



🛡️ Security

Implements JWT-based authentication for user verification.

Protects API endpoints with authorization middleware to validate user roles.

Uses input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.


📈 Use Cases

This project is suitable for applications where controlled access to project data is essential, such as:

Project Management Tools: Manage who can view, edit, or delete project details.

Collaboration Platforms: Ensure secure sharing of project information among different team members.

Enterprise Systems: Implement data access restrictions for different departments based on user roles.
