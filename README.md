# Access Control for Project Table


🛡️ Project Description

The Access Control for Project Table is a comprehensive, role-based solution designed to manage user access and permissions for project-related data. Utilizing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, the system ensures that users can only access or modify project data based on their assigned roles. This project is ideal for applications requiring robust data protection, granular access control, and efficient management of project information.

# Security Best Practices

Data Encryption: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.

JWT Expiry: Tokens have a limited lifespan to prevent misuse.

Input Validation: All inputs are sanitized to prevent NoSQL injection and XSS attacks.

Environment Variables: Sensitive data is managed using .env files.

# Use Cases

Project Management Tools: Role-based access control for managing project data securely.

Collaboration Platforms: Provides different levels of access for team members based on their roles.

Enterprise Systems: Enforces strict access control and auditing for compliance and security.
